== Cloud Pub/Sub

Spring Cloud GCP provides an abstraction layer to publish to and subscribe from Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and to create, list or delete Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions.

A Spring Boot starter is provided to auto-configure the various required Pub/Sub components.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#bill-of-materials, Spring Cloud GCP BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("com.google.cloud:spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub")
}
----

This starter is also available from https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] through the `GCP Messaging` entry.

[#pubsub-configuration]
=== Configuration

The Spring Boot starter for Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides the following configuration options.

==== Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub API Configuration

This section describes options for enabling the integration, specifying the GCP project and credentials, and setting whether the APIs should connect to an emulator for local testing.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.enabled` | Enables or disables Pub/Sub auto-configuration | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.project-id` | GCP project ID where the Google Cloud Pub/Sub API is hosted, if different from the one in the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>>
| No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.credentials.location` | OAuth2 credentials for authenticating with the
Google Cloud Pub/Sub API, if different from the ones in the
<<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.emulator-host` | The host and port of the local running emulator.
If provided, this will setup the client to connect against a running https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator[Google Cloud Pub/Sub Emulator]. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.credentials.encoded-key` | Base64-encoded contents of OAuth2 account private key for authenticating with the
Google Cloud Pub/Sub API, if different from the ones in the
<<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Cloud GCP Core Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.credentials.scopes` |
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes[OAuth2 scope] for Spring Cloud GCP
Pub/Sub credentials | No | https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub
|===

==== Publisher/Subscriber Configuration

This section describes configuration options to customize the behavior of the application's Pub/Sub publishers and subscribers.
Subscriber settings can be either global or subscription-specific.

NOTE: A custom configuration (injected through a setter in `DefaultSubscriberFactory` or a custom bean) will take precedence over auto-configuration.
Hence, if one wishes to use per-subscription configuration for a Pub/Sub setting, there must not be a custom bean for that setting.
When using auto-configuration, if both global and per-subscription configurations are provided, then the per-subscription configuration will be used.
However, if a per-subscription configuration is not set then the global or default configuration will be used.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.parallel-pull-count` | The number of pull workers | No | 1
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.subscriber.max-ack-extension-period` | The maximum period a message ack deadline will be extended, in seconds | No | 0

This is useful in conjunction with enabling message ordering because sending messages to the same region ensures they are received in order even when multiple publishers are used. | No | pubsub.googleapis.com:443
|===

===== Subscription-specific Configurations

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.subscription.[subscription-name].fully-qualified-name` | The fully-qualified subscription name in the `projects/[PROJECT]/subscriptions/[SUBSCRIPTION]` format. When this property is present, the `[subscription-name]` key does not have to match any actual resources; it's used only for logical grouping. | No | 1

The behavior when the specified limits are exceeded. | No | Block
|===

NOTE: By default, subscription-specific threads are named after fully-qualified subscription name, ex: `gcp-pubsub-subscriber-projects/project-id/subscriptions/subscription-name`.
This can be customized, by registering a `SelectiveSchedulerThreadNameProvider` bean.

==== GRPC Connection Settings

The Pub/Sub API uses the https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/service_apis_overview#grpc_api[GRPC] protocol to send API requests to the Pub/Sub service.
This section describes configuration options for customizing the GRPC behavior.

NOTE: The properties that refer to `retry` control the RPC retries for transient failures during the gRPC call to Cloud Pub/Sub server.
They do *not* control message redelivery; only message acknowledgement deadline can be used to extend or shorten the amount of time until Pub/Sub attempts redelivery.

can't increase the retry delay higher than this amount. | No | 0
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.[subscriber,publisher].retry.max-attempts`|
MaxAttempts defines the maximum number of attempts to perform.
If this value is greater than 0, and the number of attempts reaches this limit, the logic will give up retrying even if the total retry time is still lower than TotalTimeout. | No | 0
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.[subscriber,publisher].retry.jittered`|Jitter determines if the delay time should be randomized. | No | true
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.[subscriber,publisher].retry.initial-rpc-timeout-seconds`|

|===

==== Programmatic Configuration
To apply publishing customizations not covered by the properties above, you may provide custom beans of type `PublisherCustomizer` to post-process the `Publisher.Builder` object right before it is built into a `Publisher`.
The `PublisherCustomizer` beans may be annotated with Spring Framework's `@Order` annotation to ensure they are applied in a particular sequence.

=== Spring Boot Actuator Support

==== Cloud Pub/Sub Health Indicator

If you are using Spring Boot Actuator, you can take advantage of the Cloud Pub/Sub health indicator called `pubsub`.
The health indicator will verify whether Cloud Pub/Sub is up and accessible by your application.
To enable it, all you need to do is add the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator] to your project.

The `pubsub` indicator will then roll up to the overall application status visible at http://localhost:8080/actuator/health (use the `management.endpoint.health.show-details` property to view per-indicator details).

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: If your application already has actuator and Cloud Pub/Sub starters, this health indicator is enabled by default.
To disable the Cloud Pub/Sub indicator, set `management.health.pubsub.enabled` to `false`.

The health indicator validates the connection to Pub/Sub by pulling messages from a Pub/Sub subscription.

If no subscription has been specified via `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.subscription`, it will pull messages from a random subscription that is expected not to exist.
It will signal "up" if it is able to connect to GCP Pub/Sub APIs, i.e. the pull results in a response of `NOT_FOUND` or `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

If a custom subscription has been specified, this health indicator will signal "up" if messages are successfully pulled and (optionally) acknowledged, or when a successful pull is performed but no messages are returned from Pub/Sub.
Note that messages pulled from the subscription will not be acknowledged, unless you set the `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.acknowledge-messages` option to `true`.
So, take care not to configure a subscription that has a business impact, or instead leave the custom subscription out completely.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `management.health.pubsub.enabled` | Whether to enable the Pub/Sub health indicator | No | `true` with Spring Boot Actuator, `false` otherwise
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.subscription` | Subscription to health check against by pulling a message | No | Random non-existent
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.timeout-millis` | Milliseconds to wait for response from Pub/Sub before timing out | No | `2000`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.acknowledge-messages` | Whether to acknowledge messages pulled from the optionally specified subscription | No | `false`
|===

==== Cloud Pub/Sub Subscription Health Indicator

If you are using Spring Boot Actuator, you can take advantage of the Cloud Pub/Sub subscription health indicator called `pubsub-subscriber`.
The subscription health indicator will verify whether Pub/Sub subscriptions are actively processing messages from the subscription's backlog.
To enable it, you need to add the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator] to your project and the https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/reference/libraries[GCP Monitoring].
Also you need to set the following properties `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.lagThreshold`, `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.backlogThreshold`.

The `pubsub-subscriber` indicator will then roll up to the overall application status visible at http://localhost:8080/actuator/health (use the `management.endpoint.health.show-details` property to view per-indicator details).

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>google-cloud-monitoring</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The health indicator validates a subscriber's health by checking the subscription's message backlog and the last processed message.
A subscription's backlog is retrieved using Google Cloud's Monitoring Metrics. The metric used is the `num_undelivered_messages` for a subscription.

If a message has been recently processed in a reasonable time threshold, then the subscriber is healthy.
If the backlog of messages for a subscription is big but the subscriber consumes messages then subscriber is still healthy.
If there hasn't been any processing of recent messages but the backlog increases, then the subscriber is unhealthy.

NOTE: The health indicator will not behave entirely as expected if Dead Letter Queueing is enabled on the subscription being checked, num_undelivered_messages will drop down by itself after DLQ threshold is reached.

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `management.health.pubsub-subscriber.enabled` | Whether to enable the Pub/Sub Subscription health indicator | No | `true` with Spring Boot Actuator, `false` otherwise
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.lagThreshold` | Threshold in seconds over message processing lag | Yes | Provided
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.backlogThreshold` | The threshold number of messages for a subscription backlog | Yes | Provided
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.lookUpInterval` | The optional interval in seconds for subscription backlog lookup | No | `1`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.health.executorThreads` | Number of threads used for Health Check Executors | No | `4`
|===


=== Pub/Sub Operations & Template

`PubSubOperations` is an abstraction that allows Spring users to use Google Cloud Pub/Sub without depending on any Google Cloud Pub/Sub API semantics.
It provides the common set of operations needed to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
`PubSubTemplate` is the default implementation of `PubSubOperations` and it uses the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/tree/main/google-cloud-pubsub[Google Cloud Java Client for Pub/Sub] to interact with Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

==== Publishing to a topic

`PubSubTemplate` provides asynchronous methods to publish messages to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
The `publish()` method takes in a topic name to post the message to, a payload of a generic type and, optionally, a map with the message headers.
The topic name could either be a short topic name within the current project, or the fully-qualified name referring to a topic in a different project using the `projects/[project_name]/topics/[topic_name]` format.

Here is an example of how to publish a message to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=publish]
----

By default, the `SimplePubSubMessageConverter` is used to convert payloads of type `byte[]`, `ByteString`, `ByteBuffer`, and `String` to Pub/Sub messages.

===== Ordering messages

If you are relying on message converters and would like to provide an ordering key, use the `GcpPubSubHeaders.ORDERING_KEY` header.
You will also need to make sure to enable message ordering on the publisher via the `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.publisher.enable-message-ordering` property.
Additionally, if you are using multiple publishers, you will want to set the `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.publisher.endpoint` to a regional endpoint such as `"us-east1-pubsub.googleapis.com:443"` so that messages are sent to the same region and received in order.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=publish_ordering]
----

==== Subscribing to a subscription

Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows many subscriptions to be associated to the same topic.
`PubSubTemplate` allows you to listen to subscriptions via the `subscribe()` method.
When listening to a subscription, messages will be pulled from Google Cloud Pub/Sub asynchronously and passed to a user provided message handler.
The subscription name could either be a short subscription name within the current project, or the fully-qualified name referring to a subscription in a different project using the `projects/[project_name]/subscriptions/[subscription_name]` format.

===== Example
Subscribe to a subscription with a message handler:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=subscribe]
----
===== Subscribe methods
`PubSubTemplate` provides the following subscribe methods:

[cols="20,80"]
|===
h|subscribe(String subscription, Consumer<BasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> messageConsumer) | asynchronously pulls messages and passes them to `messageConsumer`
h|subscribeAndConvert(String subscription,
 			Consumer<ConvertedBasicAcknowledgeablePubsubMessage<T>> messageConsumer,
 			Class<T> payloadType) | same as `pull`, but converts message payload to `payloadType` using the converter configured in the template
|===

NOTE: As of version 1.2, subscribing by itself is not enough to keep an application running.
For a command-line application, you may want to provide your own `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` bean named `pubsubSubscriberThreadPool`, which by default creates non-daemon threads that will keep an application from stopping.
This default behavior has been overridden in Spring Cloud GCP for consistency with Cloud Pub/Sub client library, and to avoid holding up command-line applications that would like to shut down once their work is done.

==== Pulling messages from a subscription

Google Cloud Pub/Sub supports synchronous pulling of messages from a subscription.
This is different from subscribing to a subscription, in the sense that subscribing is an asynchronous task.

===== Example
Pull up to 10 messages:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=pull]
----

===== Pull methods

`PubsubTemplate` provides the following pull methods:
[cols="20,80"]
|===
h|pull(String subscription, Integer maxMessages,
       			Boolean returnImmediately) | Pulls a number of messages from a subscription, allowing for the retry settings to be configured.
       			Any messages received by `pull()` are not automatically acknowledged. See <<Acknowledging messages>>.

				The `maxMessages` parameter is the maximum limit of how many messages to pull from a subscription in a single call; this value **must** be greater than 0.
				You may omit this parameter by passing in `null`; this means there will be no limit on the number of messages pulled (`maxMessages` will be `Integer.MAX_INTEGER`).

       			If `returnImmediately` is `true`, the system will respond immediately even if it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull` response. Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time) until at least one message is available, rather than returning no messages.
h|pullAndAck | Works the same as the `pull` method and, additionally, acknowledges all received messages.

h|pullNext | Allows for a single message to be pulled and automatically acknowledged from a subscription.

h|pullAndConvert | Works the same as the `pull` method and, additionally, converts the Pub/Sub binary payload to an object of the desired type, using the converter configured in the template.
|===

WARNING: We do not recommend setting `returnImmediately` to `true`, as it may result in delayed message delivery.
"Immediately" really means 1 second, and if Pub/Sub cannot retrieve any messages from the backend in that time, it will return 0 messages, despite having messages queue up on the topic.
Therefore, we recommend setting `returnImmediately` to `false`, or using `subscribe` methods from the previous section.

===== Acknowledging messages

There are two ways to acknowledge messages.

. To acknowledge multiple messages at once, you can use the `PubSubTemplate.ack()` method.
You can also use the `PubSubTemplate.nack()` for negatively acknowledging messages.
Using these methods for acknowledging messages in batches is more efficient than acknowledging messages individually, but they *require* the collection of messages to be from the same project.

. To acknowledge messages individually you can use the `ack()` or `nack()` method on each of them (to acknowledge or negatively acknowledge, correspondingly).

NOTE: All `ack()`, `nack()`, and `modifyAckDeadline()` methods on messages, as well as `PubSubSubscriberTemplate`, are implemented asynchronously, returning a `ListenableFuture<Void>` to enable asynchronous processing.

===== Dead Letter Topics

Your application may occasionally receive a message it cannot process.
If you <<creating-a-subscription,create your `Subscription`>> passing the `Subscription.Builder` argument, you can specify a `DeadLetterPolicy` that will forward all `nack()`-ed and non-`ack()`-ed messages after a configurable amount of redelivery attempts.
See https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/dead-letter-topics[here] for more information.

// TODO(ttomsu): make this an include to working code.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public Subscription newSubscription() {
	// Must use the fully-qualified topic name.
	String fullDeadLetterTopic = PubSubTopicUtils
						.toTopicName(DEAD_LETTER_TOPIC, gcpProjectIdProvider.getProjectId())
						.toString();
	return pubSubAdmin.createSubscription(Subscription.newBuilder()
			.setName(SUBSCRIPTION_NAME)
			.setTopic(TOPIC_NAME)
			.setDeadLetterPolicy(DeadLetterPolicy.newBuilder()
					.setDeadLetterTopic(fullDeadLetterTopic)
					.setMaxDeliveryAttempts(6)
					.build()));
}
----

Dead letter topics are no different than any other topic, though some https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/dead-letter-topics#granting_forwarding_permissions[additional permissions] are necessary to ensure the Cloud Pub/Sub service can successfully `ack` the original message and re-`publish` it on the dead letter topic.

==== JSON support

For serialization and deserialization of POJOs using Jackson JSON, configure a `PubSubMessageConverter` bean, and the Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub will automatically wire it into the `PubSubTemplate`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=json_bean]
----

NOTE: Alternatively, you can set it directly by calling the `setMessageConverter()` method on the `PubSubTemplate`.
Other implementations of the `PubSubMessageConverter` can also be configured in the same manner.

Assuming you have the following class defined:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=json_convertible_class]
----

You can serialize objects to JSON on publish automatically:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=json_publish]
----

And that's how you convert messages to objects on pull:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=json_pull]
----


Please refer to our https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/main/spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-integration-pubsub-json-sample[Pub/Sub JSON Payload Sample App] as a reference for using this functionality.

=== Reactive Stream Subscriber

It is also possible to acquire a reactive stream backed by a subscription.
To do so, a Project Reactor dependency (`io.projectreactor:reactor-core`) must be added to the project.
The combination of the Pub/Sub starter and the Project Reactor dependencies will then make a `PubSubReactiveFactory` bean available, which can then be used to get a `Publisher`.

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
PubSubReactiveFactory reactiveFactory;

// ...

Flux<AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> flux
				= reactiveFactory.poll("exampleSubscription", 1000);
----

The `Flux` then represents an infinite stream of GCP Pub/Sub messages coming in through the specified subscription.
For unlimited demand, the Pub/Sub subscription will be polled regularly, at intervals determined by `pollingPeriodMs` parameter passed in when creating the `Flux`.
For bounded demand, the `pollingPeriodMs` parameter is unused.
Instead, as many messages as possible (up to the requested number) are delivered immediately, with the remaining messages delivered as they become available.

Any exceptions thrown by the underlying message retrieval logic will be passed as an error to the stream.
The error handling operators (`Flux#retry()`, `Flux#onErrorResume()` etc.) can be used to recover.

The full range of Project Reactor operations can be applied to the stream.
For example, if you only want to fetch 5 messages, you can use `limitRequest` operation to turn the infinite stream into a finite one:

[source,java]
----
Flux<AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage> fiveMessageFlux = flux.limitRequest(5);
----

Messages flowing through the `Flux` should be manually acknowledged.

[source,java]
----
flux.doOnNext(AcknowledgeablePubsubMessage::ack);
----

=== Pub/Sub management

`PubSubAdmin` is the abstraction provided by Spring Cloud GCP to manage Google Cloud Pub/Sub resources.
It allows for the creation, deletion and listing of topics and subscriptions.

NOTE: Generally when referring to topics and subscriptions, you can either use the short canonical name within the current project, or the fully-qualified name referring to a topic or subscription in a different project using the `projects/[project_name]/(topics|subscriptions)/<name>` format.

The Spring Boot starter for GCP Pub/Sub auto-configures a `PubSubAdmin` object using the `GcpProjectIdProvider` and the `CredentialsProvider` auto-configured by the Spring Boot GCP Core starter.

==== Creating a topic

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to create topics:

[source,java]
----
public Topic createTopic(String topicName)
----

Here is an example of how to create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java]
----
public void newTopic() {
    pubSubAdmin.createTopic("topicName");
}
----

==== Deleting a topic

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to delete topics:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteTopic(String topicName)
----

Here is an example of how to delete a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteTopic() {
    pubSubAdmin.deleteTopic("topicName");
}
----

==== Listing topics

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to list topics:

[source,java]
----
public List<Topic> listTopics
----

Here is an example of how to list every Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic name in a project:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=list_topics]
----

==== Creating a subscription

`PubSubAdmin` implements several methods to create subscriptions to existing topics:

[source,java]
----
public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName)

public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName, Integer ackDeadline)

public Subscription createSubscription(String subscriptionName, String topicName, Integer ackDeadline, String pushEndpoint)

public Subscription createSubscription(Subscriber.Builder builder)
----

The default value for `ackDeadline` is 10 seconds.
If `pushEndpoint` isn’t specified, the subscription uses message pulling, instead.
You can also pass a `Subscription.Builder` for full control over any options or features available in the client library.

Here is an example of how to create a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription:

[source,java]
----
public Subscription newSubscription() {
    return pubSubAdmin.createSubscription("subscriptionName", "topicName", 15);
}
----

==== Deleting a subscription

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to delete subscriptions:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteSubscription(String subscriptionName)
----

Here is an example of how to delete a Google Cloud Pub/Sub subscription:

[source,java]
----
public void deleteSubscription() {
    pubSubAdmin.deleteSubscription("subscriptionName");
}
----

==== Listing subscriptions

`PubSubAdmin` implements a method to list subscriptions:

[source,java]
----
public List<Subscription> listSubscriptions()
----

Here is an example of how to list every subscription name in a project:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project-root}/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/test/java/com/google/cloud/spring/autoconfigure/pubsub/it/PubSubTemplateDocumentationIntegrationTests.java[tag=list_subscriptions]
----
