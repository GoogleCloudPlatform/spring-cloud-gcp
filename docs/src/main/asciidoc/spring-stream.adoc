== Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud GCP provides a https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] binder to Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The provided binder relies on the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/main/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/spring/pubsub/integration[Spring Integration Channel Adapters for Google Cloud Pub/Sub].

=== Overview

This binder binds producers to Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and consumers to subscriptions.

NOTE: Partitioning is currently not supported by this binder.

=== Configuration

You can configure the Spring Cloud Stream Binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub to automatically generate the underlying resources, like the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions for producers and consumers.
For that, you can use the `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.<channelName>.<consumer|producer>.auto-create-resources` property, which is turned ON by default.

Starting with version 1.1, these and other binder properties can be configured globally for all the bindings, e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.default.consumer.auto-create-resources`.

If you are using Pub/Sub auto-configuration from the Spring Cloud GCP Pub/Sub Starter, you should refer to the <<pubsub-configuration,configuration>> section for other Pub/Sub parameters.

NOTE: To use this binder with a https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator[running emulator], configure its host and port via `spring.cloud.gcp.pubsub.emulator-host`.

==== Producer Synchronous Sending Configuration
By default, this binder will send messages to Cloud Pub/Sub asynchronously.
If synchronous sending is preferred (for example, to allow propagating errors back to the sender), set `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.default.producer.sync` property to `true`.

==== Producer Destination Configuration

If automatic resource creation is turned ON and the topic corresponding to the destination name does not exist, it will be created.

For example, for the following configuration, a topic called `myEvents` would be created.

.application.properties
[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.destination=myEvents
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.events.producer.auto-create-resources=true
----

==== Consumer Destination Configuration

A `PubSubInboundChannelAdapter` will be configured for your consumer endpoint.
You may adjust the ack mode of the consumer endpoint using the `ack-mode` property.
The ack mode controls how messages will be acknowledged when they are successfully received.
The three possible options are: `AUTO` (default), `AUTO_ACK`, and `MANUAL`.
These options are described in detail in the <<inbound-channel-adapter-using-pubsub-streaming-pull, Pub/Sub channel adapter documentation>>.

.application.properties
[source]
----
# How to set the ACK mode of the consumer endpoint.
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.{CONSUMER_NAME}.consumer.ack-mode=AUTO_ACK
----

With automatic resource creation turned ON for a consumer, the library creates a topic and/or a subscription if they do not exist.
The topic name becomes the same as the destination name, and the subscription name follows these rules (in order of precedence):

* A user-defined, pre-existing subscription (use `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.{CONSUMER_NAME}.consumer.subscriptionName`)
* A consumer group using the topic name (use `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.group` to create a subscription named `<topicName>.<group>`)
* If neither of the above are specified, the library creates an anonymous subscription with the name `anonymous.<destinationName>.<randomUUID>`.
Then when the binder shuts down, the library automatically cleans up all Pub/Sub subscriptions created for anonymous consumer groups.

For example, with this configuration:

.application.properties
[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.destination=myEvents
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.events.consumer.auto-create-resources=false
----
Only an anonymous subscription named `anonymous.myEvents.a6d83782-c5a3-4861-ac38-e6e2af15a7be` is created and later cleaned up.

In another example, with the following configuration:

.application.properties
[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.destination=myEvents
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.events.consumer.auto-create-resources=true

# specify consumer group, and avoid anonymous consumer group generation
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.events.group=consumerGroup1
----
These resources will be created:

* A topic named `myEvents`
* A subscription named `myEvents.consumerGroup1`

==== Header Mapping
You can filter incoming and outgoing message headers with `allowHeaders` property.
For example, for a consumer to allow only two headers, provide a comma separated list like this:

.application.properties
----
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.<consumerFunction>-in-0.consumer.allowedHeaders=allowed1, allowed2
----
Where <consumerFunction> should be replaced by the method which is consuming/reading messages from Cloud Pub/Sub and allowed1, allowed2 is the comma separated list of headers that the user wants to keep.



A similar style is applicable for producers as well. For example:

.application.properties
----
spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.bindings.<producerFunction>-out-0.producer.allowedHeaders=allowed3,allowed4
----
Where <producerFunction> should be replaced by the method which is producing/sending messages to Cloud Pub/Sub and allowed3, allowed4 is the comma separated list of headers that user wants to map. All other headers will be removed before the message is sent to Cloud Pub/Sub.



==== Endpoint Customization

You may customize channel routing by defining a `ConsumerEndpointCustomizer` in your autoconfiguration. This is useful if you want to customize the default configurations provided by the Pub/Sub Spring Cloud Stream Binder.

The example below demonstrates how to use a `ConsumerEndpointCustomizer` to override the default error channel configured by the binder.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ConsumerEndpointCustomizer<PubSubInboundChannelAdapter> messageChannelAdapter() {
    return (endpoint, destinationName, group) -> {
        NamedComponent namedComponent = (NamedComponent) endpoint.getOutputChannel();
        String channelName = namedComponent.getBeanName();
        endpoint.setErrorChannelName(channelName + ".errors");
    };
}
----

=== Binding with Functions

Since version 3.0, Spring Cloud Stream supports a functional programming model natively.
This means that the only requirement for turning your application into a sink is presence of a `java.util.function.Consumer` bean in the application context.

```
@Bean
public Consumer<UserMessage> logUserMessage() {
  return userMessage -> {
    // process message
  }
};
```

A source application is one where a `Supplier` bean is present.
It can return an object, in which case Spring Cloud Stream will invoke the supplier repeatedly.
Alternatively, the function can return a reactive stream, which will be used as is.

```
@Bean
Supplier<Flux<UserMessage>> generateUserMessages() {
  return () -> /* flux creation logic */;
}
```

A processor application works similarly to a source application, except it is triggered by presence of a `Function` bean.


=== Binding with Annotations

NOTE: As of version 3.0, annotation binding is considered legacy.

To set up a sink application in this style, you would associate a class with a binding interface, such as the built-in `Sink` interface.

```
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class SinkExample {

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void handleMessage(UserMessage userMessage) {
		// process message
	}
}
```

To set up a source application, you would similarly associate a class with a built-in `Source` interface, and inject an instance of it provided by Spring Cloud Stream.

```
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class SourceExample {

	@Autowired
	private Source source;

	public void sendMessage() {
		this.source.output().send(new GenericMessage<>(/* your object here */));
	}
}
```


=== Streaming vs. Polled Input

Many Spring Cloud Stream applications will use the built-in `Sink` binding, which triggers the _streaming_ input binder creation.
Messages can then be consumed with an input handler marked by `@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)` annotation, at whatever rate Pub/Sub sends them.

For more control over the rate of message arrival, a polled input binder can be set up by defining a custom binding interface with an `@Input`-annotated method returning `PollableMessageSource`.

[source,java]
----
public interface PollableSink {

	@Input("input")
	PollableMessageSource input();
}
----

The `PollableMessageSource` can then be injected and queried, as needed.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(PollableSink.class)
public class SinkExample {

    @Autowired
    PollableMessageSource destIn;

    @Bean
    public ApplicationRunner singlePollRunner() {
        return args -> {
            // This will poll only once.
            // Add a loop or a scheduler to get more messages.
            destIn.poll(message -> System.out.println("Message retrieved: " + message));
        };
    }
}
----

By default, the polling will only get 1 message at a time.
Use the `spring.cloud.stream.gcp.pubsub.default.consumer.maxFetchSize` property to fetch additional messages per network roundtrip.
