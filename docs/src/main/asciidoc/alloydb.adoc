== AlloyDB

Spring Framework on Google Cloud adds integrations with
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html[Spring JDBC], so you can run your PostgreSQL databases in https://cloud.google.com/alloydb[Google AlloyDB] using Spring JDBC.

The AlloyDB support is provided by Spring Framework on Google Cloud in the form of a Spring Boot AlloyDB starter for PostgreSQL.
The role of the starters is to read configuration from properties and assume default settings so that user experience connecting to PostgreSQL is as simple as possible.

=== JDBC Support
Maven and Gradle coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#bill-of-materials, Spring Framework on Google Cloud BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-alloydb</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("com.google.cloud:spring-cloud-gcp-starter-alloydb")
}
----

==== Prerequisites

In order to use the Spring Boot Starters for Google AlloyDB, the Google AlloyDB API must be enabled in your Google Cloud project.

To do that, go to the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library[API library page] of the Google Cloud Console, search for "AlloyDB API" and enable the option that is called "AlloyDB API" .


==== Spring Boot Starter for Google AlloyDB

The Spring Boot Starters for Google AlloyDB provide an autoconfigured https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[`DataSource`] object.
Coupled with Spring JDBC, it provides a
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html#jdbc-JdbcTemplate[`JdbcTemplate`] object bean that allows for operations such as querying and modifying a database.

[source,java]
----
public List<Map<String, Object>> listUsers() {
    return jdbcTemplate.queryForList("SELECT * FROM user;");
}
----

You can rely on
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html#boot-features-connect-to-production-database[Spring Boot data source autoconfiguration] to configure a `DataSource` bean.
In other words, properties like the username, `spring.datasource.username`, and password, `spring.datasource.password` can be used.
There is also some configuration specific to Google AlloyDB (see "AlloyDB Configuration Properties" section below).

|===
| Property name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.datasource.username` | Database username | No | `postgres`
| `spring.datasource.password` | Database password | No | `null`
| `spring.datasource.driver-class-name` | JDBC driver to use. | No | `org.postgresql.Driver`
|===

NOTE: If you provide your own `spring.datasource.url`, it will be ignored, unless you disable AlloyDB autoconfiguration with `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.enabled=false`.

===== `DataSource` creation flow

Spring Boot starter for Google AlloyDB registers an `AlloyDbEnvironmentPostProcessor` that provides a correctly formatted `spring.datasource.url` property to the environment based on the properties mentioned above.
It also provides defaults for `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.driver-class-name`, which can be overridden.
The starter also configures credentials for the JDBC connection based on the AlloyDB properties below.

The user properties and the properties provided by the `AlloyDbEnvironmentPostProcessor` are then used by https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html[Spring Boot] to create the `DataSource`.
You can select the type of connection pool (e.g., Tomcat, HikariCP, etc.) by https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-sql.html#boot-features-connect-to-production-database[adding their dependency to the classpath].

Using the created `DataSource` in conjunction with Spring JDBC provides you with a fully configured and operational `JdbcTemplate` object that you can use to interact with your AlloyDB database.
You can connect to your database with as little as a database and instance names.

=== AlloyDB IAM database authentication

Currently, AlloyDB supports https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/manage-iam-authn[IAM database authentication].
It allows you to connect to the database using an IAM account, rather than a predefined database username and password.
You will need to do the following to enable it:

. In your AlloyDB instance settings, turn on the `alloydb.iam_authentication` flag.
. Add the IAM user or service account to the list of cluster users.
. In the application settings, set `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.enable-iam-auth` to `true`. Note that this will also set the database protocol `sslmode` to `disabled`, as it's required for IAM authentication to work.
However, it doesn't compromise the security of the communication because the connection is always encrypted.
. Set `spring.datasource.username` to the IAM user or service account created in step 2. Note that IAM user or service account still needs to be https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html[granted permissions] before modifying or querying the database.

=== AlloyDB Configuration Properties

|===
| Property name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.enabled` | Enables or disables AlloyDB auto configuration | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.database-name` | The name of the database to connect to. | Yes |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.instance-connection-uri` | The Google AlloyDB instance connection URI. | Yes |
For example, `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION_ID/clusters/CLUSTER_ID/instances/INSTANCE_ID`.
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.ip-type` | Specifies a preferred IP type for connecting to a AlloyDB instance. (`PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `PSC`) | No | `PRIVATE`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.enable-iam-auth` | Specifies whether to enable IAM database authentication. | No | `False`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.admin-service-endpoint` | An alternate AlloyDB API endpoint. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.quota-project` | The project ID for quota and billing. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.target-principal` | The service account to impersonate when connecting to the database and database admin API. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.delegates` | A comma-separated list of service accounts delegates. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.named-connector` | The name of the named connector. | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.credentials.location` | File system path to the Google OAuth2 credentials private key file.
Used to authenticate and authorize new connections to a Google AlloyDB instance. | No
|===

NOTE: You need to run your application from a VM within the created VPC to connect to AlloyDB using its private IP. 
To connect using Public IP, enable the AlloyDB instance's for external connections 
following https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/connect-public-ip[these instructions] and 
add `spring.cloud.gcp.alloydb.ip-type=PUBLIC` to your `application.properties`.

=== Troubleshooting tips

[#connection-issues]
==== Connection issues
If you're not able to connect to a database and see an endless loop of `Connecting to AlloyDB instance [...] on IP [...]`, it's likely that exceptions are being thrown and logged at a level lower than your logger's level.
This may be the case with HikariCP, if your logger is set to INFO or higher level.

To see what's going on in the background, you should add a `logback.xml` file to your application resources folder, that looks like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml"/>
  <logger name="com.zaxxer.hikari.pool" level="DEBUG"/>
</configuration>
----

==== PostgreSQL: `java.net.SocketException: already connected` issue

We found this exception to be common if your Maven project's parent is `spring-boot` version `1.5.x`, or in any other circumstance that would cause the version of the `org.postgresql:postgresql` dependency to be an older one (e.g., `9.4.1212.jre7`).

To fix this, re-declare the dependency in its correct version.
For example, in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
  <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
  <version>42.7.3</version>
</dependency>
----
