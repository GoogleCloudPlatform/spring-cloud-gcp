== Cloud Monitoring

Google Cloud provides a service called https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/[Cloud Monitoring], and https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/stackdriver[Micrometer] can be used with it to easily instrument Spring Boot applications for observability.

Spring Boot already provides auto-configuration for Cloud Monitoring.
This module enables auto-detection of the `project-id` and `credentials`.
Also, it can be customized.

Maven coordinates, using <<getting-started.adoc#bill-of-materials, Spring Framework on Google Cloud BOM>>:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Gradle coordinates:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("com.google.cloud:spring-cloud-gcp-starter-metrics")
}
----

You must enable Cloud Monitoring API from the Google Cloud Console in order to capture metrics.
Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring.googleapis.com/overview[Cloud Monitoring API] for your project and make sure itâ€™s enabled.

Spring Boot Starter for Cloud Monitoring uses Micrometer.

=== Configuration

All configurations are optional:

|===
| Name | Description | Required | Default value
| `spring.cloud.gcp.metrics.enabled` | Auto-configure Micrometer to send metrics to Cloud Monitoring. | No | `true`
| `spring.cloud.gcp.metrics.project-id` | Overrides the project ID from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Framework on Google Cloud Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.metrics.credentials.location` | Overrides the credentials location from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Framework on Google Cloud Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.metrics.credentials.encoded-key` | Overrides the credentials encoded key from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Framework on Google Cloud Module>> | No |
| `spring.cloud.gcp.metrics.credentials.scopes` | Overrides the credentials scopes from the <<spring-cloud-gcp-core,Spring Framework on Google Cloud Module>> | No |
|===

You can use core Spring Boot Actuator properties to control reporting frequency, etc.
Read https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics-export-stackdriver[Spring Boot Actuator documentation] for more information on Stackdriver Actuator configurations.

==== Metrics Disambiguation

By default, `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-metrics`/the `StackdriverMeterRegistry` does not add any application/pod specific tags to the metrics,
thus google is unable to distinguish between multiple metric sources.
This could lead to the following warning inside your applications logs:

[source,txt]
----
2022-08-15 10:26:00.248  WARN 1 --- [trics-publisher] i.m.s.StackdriverMeterRegistry           : failed to send metrics to Stackdriver
----

The actual cause message may vary:

[source,txt]
----
One or more TimeSeries could not be written:
One or more points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period configured for the metric.: global{} timeSeries[4]: custom.googleapis.com/process/uptime{};
One or more points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period configured for the metric.: global{} timeSeries[6]: custom.googleapis.com/system/load/average/1m{};
One or more points ...
----

or even:

[source,txt]
----
Caused by: io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2Exception: Header size exceeded max allowed size (10240)
----

(due to the error message being too long)

Google rejects metric updates for entries that it has received before (from another application) for the same interval.
To avoid these conflicts and in order to distinguish between applications/instances you should add a configuration similar to this:

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  metrics:
    tags:
      app: my-foobar-service
      instance: ${random.uuid}
----

Instead of the random uuid you could also use the pod id/the hostname or some other instance id.
Read more about custom tags https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.metrics.customizing.common-tags[here].
