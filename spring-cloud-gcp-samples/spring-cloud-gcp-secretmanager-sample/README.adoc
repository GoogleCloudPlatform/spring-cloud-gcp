= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Secret Manager Sample Application

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Framework on Google Cloud Secret Manager integration.
The sample demonstrates how one can access Secret Manager secrets through a `@ConfigurationProperties` class and also through `@Value` annotations on fields.

== Running the Sample

1. Create a Google Cloud project with https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable-billing[billing enabled], if you don't have one already.

2. Enable the Secret Manager API from the "APIs & Services" menu of the Google Cloud Console.
This can be done using the `gcloud` command line tool:
+
[source]
----
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
----

3. Authenticate in one of two ways:

a. Use the Google Cloud SDK to https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[authenticate with application default credentials].
This method is convenient but should only be used in local development.
b. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[Create a new service account], download its private key and point the `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.credentials.location` property to it.
+
Such as: `spring.cloud.gcp.secretmanager.credentials.location=file:/path/to/creds.json`

4. Using the https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager[Secret Manager UI in Cloud Console], create a new secret named `application-secret` and set it to any value.
Instructions for using the Secret Manager UI can be found in the https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/creating-and-accessing-secrets#secretmanager-create-secret-web[Secret Manager documentation].

5. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

6. Run `$ mvn spring-boot:run` command from the same directory as this sample's `pom.xml` file.

7. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser or use the `Web Preview` button in Cloud Shell to preview the app
on port 8080. Your secret value is injected into your application through the `WebController` and you will see it
displayed.
+
[source]
----
applicationSecret: Hello world.
----
+
You will also see some web forms that allow you to create, read, and update secrets in Secret Manager.
This is done by using the `SecretManagerTemplate`.
+
Finally, you can view all of your secrets using the https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager[Secret Manager Cloud Console UI], which is the source of truth for all of your secrets in Secret Manager.

8. Refresh the secrets without restarting the application:

a. After running the application, change your secrets using https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager[Secret Manager Cloud Console UI].

b. To refresh the secret, send the following command to your server from which hosting the application:
+
[source]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
----
Note that only `@ConfigurationProperties` annotated with `@RefreshScope` got the updated value.
