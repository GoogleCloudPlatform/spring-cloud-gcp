= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Stream for Pub/Sub Dead Letter Topic Code Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Cloud Stream binder for Google Cloud Pub/Sub with Dead Letter Topics.

The sample app prompts a user for a message and username.
That data is added to a `UserMessage` object, together with the time of message creation, and is sent through Google Cloud Pub/Sub to a sink that `nack()`s the message.
Pub/Sub will attempt to redeliver the message up to maximum number of retries before routing it to the configured dead letter topic.\
This sample app also listens to this dead letter topic, and logs any messages received.

If the topics for the sink, source, and dead letter topic do not exist, the binder will automatically create them in Google Cloud Pub/Sub based on the values in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties].

== Running the code sample

1. Configure your credentials and project ID by following link:../../docs/src/main/asciidoc/core.adoc#project-id[these instructions].
+
Alternatively, if you have the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK] installed and initialized, and are logged in with https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[application default credentials], Spring will auto-discover those parameters for you.

2. Set your project ID using the `spring.cloud.gcp.project-id` property in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] or use the `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]` Cloud SDK command.

3. In the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file, a topic and a dead letter topic are already preconfigured for you.
The topics will be created in your account if they do not already exist.

4. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account needs the publisher role to publish dead-lettered messages to the dead letter topic and the subscriber role to forward messages from the subscription to the dead letter topic. Please grant both the roles to the service account you are using by going to the subscription details page on Pantheon.

5. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

6. Run `$ mvn spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample
(spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-stream-dead-letter-sample) to get the app running.

7. Browse to `localhost:8080` or use the `Web Preview` button in Cloud Shell to preview the app on port 8080,
and type in a message, a username, and press the `Post it!` button.

8. Verify in your app's logs that a similar message was posted:
