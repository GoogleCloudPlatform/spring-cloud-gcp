= Spring Cloud GCP PostgreSQL Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to connect to a Postgres Google Cloud SQL instance using the link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-postgresql[Spring Cloud GCP PostgreSQL Starter].
If you are interested in MySQL as well, you may refer to the link:../spring-cloud-gcp-sql-mysql-sample[MySQL sample app].

You will create an instance, a database within the instance, populate the database and then query it.

== Setup

1. Follow https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/quickstart[these instructions] to set up a Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.

2. Create a Google Cloud SQL instance from the https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances[Google Cloud Console Cloud SQL page].
Choose "Postgres" as your database engine.
You will be asked to set a password for the `postgres` root user; remember this value.

3. Still within the Google Cloud Console SQL page, create a new database in the instance from the "Databases" section.

4. Open the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and set the following properties:
- `spring.datasource.password` - Set this to the password that you chose for the `postgres` user.
- `spring.cloud.gcp.sql.database-name` - Set this to the name of the database you created.
- `spring.cloud.gcp.sql.instance-connection-name` - Set this to the instance name of your Postgres instance.
The instance-connection-name should be in the form: `[gcp-project-id]:[region]:[instance-name]`.
+
For example, your instance connection name might look like: `my-gcp-project:us-central1:postgres-test-instance`

+
If you would like to use a different user, set the `spring.datasource.username` property appropriately.

5. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud SQL.
+
Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

6. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

== Running the application

You can run the `SqlApplication` Spring Boot app by running the following command in the same directory as this
sample (spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-sql-postgres-sample):

`$ mvn spring-boot:run`

The database will be populated based on the link:src/main/resources/schema.sql[schema.sql] and link:src/main/resources/data.sql[data.sql] files.

When the application is up, navigate to http://localhost:8080/getTuples in your browser, or use the `Web Preview`
button in Cloud Shell to preview the app on port 8080. This will print the contents of the `users` table.
