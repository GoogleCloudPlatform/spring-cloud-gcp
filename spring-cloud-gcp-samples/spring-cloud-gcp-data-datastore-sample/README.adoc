= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Cloud Datastore Starter Example

This code sample demonstrates how to read and write POJOs from Google Cloud Datastore using the Spring
Data Cloud Datastore module link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-datastore[Spring Framework on Google Cloud Cloud Datastore Starter].

== Running the example

. Create a new Cloud Datastore database in your Google Cloud project if this has not already been done to allow
Cloud Datastore to create and store entities.
[start=2]
. https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring
Boot Starter for Google Cloud Datastore.
+
Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
+
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.datastore.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

. Run the `DatastoreRepositoryExample` Spring Boot console app by running `$ mvn spring-boot:run` in the same directory
as this sample's `pom.xml`.
This causes the app to generate sample `Singer` objects filled with some demo data and persists them to Cloud Datastore.
These POJOs are then retrieved and their contents are printed in the output.
