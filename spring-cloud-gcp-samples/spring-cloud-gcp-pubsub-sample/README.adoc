= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Pub/Sub Code Sample

This is an example application that demonstrates how to use the Spring Framework on Google Cloud Pub/Sub abstraction to do things like:

* Create a topic
* Create a subscription for a topic
* Publish a message to a topic and process it
* Listen to an active subscription
* Delete a topic
* Delete a subscription

The sample uses the `PubSubAdmin` class to perform administrative tasks like creating resources and
`PubSubTemplate` to perform operations like publishing messages and listening to subscriptions.

== Setup

To run this code sample, you must have a Google Cloud project with billing and the Google
Cloud Pub/Sub API enabled.

Install and initialize the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK].
Log in with application default credentials using the following command:

----
$ gcloud auth application-default login
----

Alternatively, create a new service account from the https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/project[Google Cloud Console IAM Service Accounts] page, with the `Pub/Sub Editor` role.
Download the service account private key.
In the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file, set the `spring.cloud.gcp.project-id` value to your project ID and `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` to the local file system path of the private key you downloaded.

Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

== Running the code

Open a terminal window and change directories to the root of this app (spring-cloud-gcp-samples/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-sample).

Run the following command from that directory:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

This will launch a local web server listening on port 8080. Go to http://localhost:8080 or use the `Web Preview` button
in Cloud Shell to preview the app on port 8080.

One flow you can follow is to:

1. Create topic `exampleTopic`.

2. Create subscription `exampleSubscription` for topic `exampleTopic`.
+
This creates a subscription and automatically starts listening to it.
Any new messages in the subscription are logged.

3. Subscribe to the `exampleSubscription` subscription.

4. Send message `Hello world!` to topic `exampleTopic`.
+
You should see the following message logged:
+
----
Message received from exampleSubscription subscription: Hello world!
----

5. Delete subscription `exampleSubscription`.

6. Delete topic `exampleTopic`.
