= Spring Framework on Google Cloud Vision Sample Application

This code sample shows how the Spring Framework on Google Cloud integrations can simplify the use of Google Cloud Vision APIs.

It uses the https://cloud.google.com/vision/[Google Cloud Vision API] to extract information about a picture.
We take advantage of the link:/spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter[Spring Framework on Google Cloud starter] to retrieve the Google Cloud credentials that we will use to authenticate with the API.

== Running the sample

1. Create a Google Cloud project with https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable-billing[billing enabled], if you don't have one already.

2. Enable the Google Cloud Vision API from the "APIs & Services" menu of the Google Cloud Console.

3. Authenticate in one of two ways:

a. Use the Google Cloud SDK to https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#toolcloudsdk[authenticate with application default credentials].
b. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[Create a new service account], download its private key and point the `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location` property to it.
+
Such as: `spring.cloud.gcp.credentials.location=file:/path/to/creds.json`

4. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

5. Run the `$ mvn spring-boot:run` command from the same directory as this sample's `pom.xml` file.

6. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser or use the `Web Preview` button in Cloud Shell to preview the app
on port 8080, paste a URL to an image and press the `Submit` button.

7. You will see a readable version of the Google Cloud Vision API response, which contains the words that Google Cloud Vision attributed to your image, as well as a percentage of certainty.

In this case, by using the Spring Framework on Google Cloud Core Boot starter, you can inject a `CredentialsProvider` object which you can pass to our API to provide the correct Google credentials.
You don't need to set any environment variables for authentication to work.
