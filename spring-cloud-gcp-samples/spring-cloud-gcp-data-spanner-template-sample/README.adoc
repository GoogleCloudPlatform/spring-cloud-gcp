= Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Spanner Starter Example using "Template"

This code sample demonstrates how to read and write POJOs from Google Cloud Spanner using the Spring
Data Cloud Spanner module link:../../spring-cloud-gcp-starters/spring-cloud-gcp-starter-data-spanner[Spring Cloud GCP Cloud Spanner Starter].

== Running the example

=== Running on GCP

Create a new Cloud Spanner instance named "spring-demo".
The example application will create the database and tables if they do not already exist.

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login[If you are authenticated in the Cloud SDK], your credentials will be automatically found by the Spring Boot Starter for Google Cloud Spanner.

Alternatively, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[create a service account from the Google Cloud Console] and download its private key.
Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

=== Running  locally using emulator
If you would like to run the sample locally using Cloud Spanner emulator, please follow https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator[this steps] to set up and start the emulator.

After that, you would need to create an instance using this command:
----
$ gcloud spanner instances create spring-demo --config=emulator-config --description="Test Instance" --nodes=1
----

Add the following property to `application.properties`:

----
spring.cloud.gcp.spanner.emulator.enabled=true
----

Note that the `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable is NOT needed in this case as `GcpSpannerEmulatorAutoConfiguration` will define a default hostname and port (i.e, localhost:9010) for the emulator.

=== Running the application
Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

Run the `SpannerTemplateExample`  Spring Boot console apps.
This causes the app to generate sample `Trade` objects filled with some demo data and persists them to the Cloud Spanner table created earlier.
These POJOs are then retrieved and their contents are printed in the browser.

.. To run the SpannerTemplateExample:

  `mvn spring-boot:run`

Successful execution will print the trades and terminate.
