Then, uncomment the `spring.cloud.gcp.firestore.credentials.location` property in the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties] file and fill its value with the path to your service account private key on your local file system, prepended with `file:`.

. Run `$ mvn clean install` from the root directory of the project.

. In the same directory as this sample's `pom.xml`, execute the following command to run the `FirestoreSampleApp`
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
