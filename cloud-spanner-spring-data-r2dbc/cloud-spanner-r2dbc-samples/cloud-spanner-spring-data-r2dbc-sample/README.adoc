# Cloud Spanner Spring Data R2DBC sample

This sample creates a table called `BOOK` on application startup, and deletes it prior to application shutdown.

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample from the command line, providing `spanner.instance`, `spanner.database` and `gcp.project` properties:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dspanner.instance=[SPANNER-INSTANCE] -Dspanner.database=[SPANNER-DATABASE] -Dgcp.project=GCP-PROJECT"
```

2. Visit http://localhost:8080/index.html

3. Try the different actions available -- listing books, adding a new book, and searching for a book by its ID.
