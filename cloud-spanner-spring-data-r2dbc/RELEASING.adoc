# How to Release to Maven Central

All scripts can be found in the `.kokoro` directory.


## Snapshots

A commit to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/continuous` job that will publish snapshots to https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/google/cloud/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/)[Sonatype Snapshots repository].

## Releases

. Run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/stage` Kokoro job.

. In the build logs, find the ID of the staging repository. You should see a log line that looks something like this:
```
[INFO]  * Created staging repository with ID "comgooglecloud-1416".
```
The `{STAGING_ID}` in this case is `comgooglecloud-1416`.

. Verify staged artifacts by going to `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/{STAGING_ID}/com/google/cloud/`
+
NOTE: You can also view all staged artifacts at http://oss.sonatype.org. To get access to `com.google.cloud` group ID, please make a request similar to https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-52371[this one] and ask someone who already has access to this group ID to vouch for you in the issue comments.)

. If you want to drop the staged artifacts, run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/drop` Kokoro job, while providing the staging repository ID as an environment variable like `STAGING_REPOSITORY_ID=comgooglecloud-1416`.

. If you want to release the staged artifacts, run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/promote` Kokoro job, while providing the staging repository ID as an environment variable like `STAGING_REPOSITORY_ID=comgooglecloud-1416`.

. Verify that the new version has been published to Maven Central by checking https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/google/cloud/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/[here]. This might take a while.

. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-spanner-r2dbc/releases[Create] a new release on GitHub.

. Increment the project base version. For example, from `0.7.0-SNAPSHOT` to `0.8.0-SNAPSHOT`.
