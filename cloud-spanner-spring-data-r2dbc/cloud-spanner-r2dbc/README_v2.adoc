# Cloud Spanner R2DBC Driver V2 (Client Library-based)

The original version of Cloud Spanner R2DBC driver was based on direct communication to Cloud Spanner gRPC endpoints.
V2 is built on top of the Cloud Spanner client library, allowing for consistent behavior between JDBC and R2DBC drivers.

To activate V2, provide an option named `client-implementation` with the value of `client-library`, as in the example below.
```java
ConnectionFactories.get(
          ConnectionFactoryOptions.builder()
              ...
              .option(Option.valueOf("client-implementation"), "client-library")
              .build());
```

## Transactions

### Read-Write Transactions
Read-write transactions are supported natively through R2DBC SPI.

```java
Mono.from(connectionFactory.create())
            .flatMapMany(c -> Flux.concat(
                c.beginTransaction(),
                ...
                c.commitTransaction(),
                c.close()))
```

### Read-Only Transactions
Read-only transactions, including stale transactions, can be used by downcasting the `Connection` object to `SpannerClientLibraryConnection` and calling `beginReadonlyTransaction()` on it.
Invoking `beginReadonlyTransaction()` without parameters will begin a new strongly consistent readonly transaction.
To customize staleness, pass in a `TimestampBound` parameter.
```java
Mono.from(connectionFactory.create())
            .flatMapMany(c ->
                Flux.concat(
                          conn.beginReadonlyTransaction(TimestampBound.ofExactStaleness(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)),
                            ...
                          conn.commitTransaction(),
                    )
```
NOTE: Readonly transactions must be closed by calling `commit()` before starting a new read-write or a read-only transaction.

### Partitioned DML transactions
Partitioned DML transactions are not supported at this time.

### Nesting transactions
Cloud Spanner does not support nested transactions, so each transaction must be either committed or rolled back.
For readonly transactions, either committing or rolling back will result in closing of the readonly transaction.
