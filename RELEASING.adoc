= Spring Cloud GCP release process

All scripts can be found in the `.kokoro` directory.


## Snapshots

A commit to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/spring-cloud-gcp/continuous` job that will publish snapshots to link:https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/google/cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/[Sonatype Snapshots repository].


## Releases

As opposed to the 1.x releases, the 2.0 release happens independent of the Spring Cloud release train.
To simplify the process, perform this list of prerequisites before asking the release admin to run the release scripts.

. Ensure that modules that shouldn't be released are not included in the `<modules>` block in the `release` profile of `pom.xml`.

. Run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/spring-cloud-gcp/stage` Kokoro job.

. In the build logs, find the ID of the staging repository. You should see a log line that looks something like this:
```
[INFO]  * Created staging repository with ID "comgooglecloud-1416".
```
The `{STAGING_ID}` in this case is `comgooglecloud-1416`.

. Verify staged artifacts by going to `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/{STAGING_ID}/com/google/cloud/`
+
NOTE: You can also view all staged artifacts at http://oss.sonatype.org.
To get access to `com.google.cloud` group ID, please make a request similar to https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-52371[this one] and ask someone who already has access to this group ID to vouch for you in the issue comments.

. If you want to drop the staged artifacts, run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/spring-cloud-gcp/drop` Kokoro job.
Provide the staging repository ID as an environment variable (i.e. `STAGING_REPOSITORY_ID=comgooglecloud-1416`).

. If you want to release the staged artifacts, run the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/spring-cloud-gcp/promote` Kokoro job.
Providing the staging repository ID as an environment variable (i.e. `STAGING_REPOSITORY_ID=comgooglecloud-1416`).

. Verify that the new version has been published to Maven Central by checking https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/google/cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/[here].
This might take a while.

. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp/releases[Create] a new release on GitHub.

. Publish the Javadocs (see section below).

. Confirm the reference documentation was published: https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/spring-cloud-gcp/$RELEASE_VERSION/reference/html/index.html. See section below for more information.

. Increment the project base _patch_ version. For example, from `2.0.6-SNAPSHOT` to `2.0.7-SNAPSHOT`, do:
```
$ ./mvnw versions:set -DprocessAllModules -DnewVersion=2.0.7-SNAPSHOT
```

== Uploading Javadocs

After releasing a new version of Spring Cloud GCP, you will need to upload the javadocs for the released version.

The latest version of the docs can be accessed at the `latest/` url:
https://googleapis.dev/java/spring-cloud-gcp/latest/index.html

1. Locate and open the `prod:cloud-java-frameworks/spring-cloud-gcp/publish_javadoc` Kokoro job.

2. Add a new Github SCM and fill out the following parameters:

    - SCM Name: Set this to `spring-cloud-gcp`
    - Committish: Set this to the name of the new release branch or tag that you want to publish javadocs for (like `1.2.x` or `v2.0.4`).
      Note that you must already have the `.kokoro/` scripts in the branch that you wish to publish javadocs for.

3. Run the job.

4. Verify that the javadocs are published.
All uploaded javadocs will be published under the following URL:
+
----
https://googleapis.dev/java/spring-cloud-gcp/{BRANCH_VERSION_NAME}/index.html
----
+
Example: If you published the javadocs for version `2.0.4`, then the URL would be: https://googleapis.dev/java/spring-cloud-gcp/2.0.4/index.html


== Updating Spring Documentation

Our Spring documentation (a.k.a. reference docs, or refdocs) is automatically published to GitHub Pages when a new release is published.
This process is carried out by link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/main/.github/workflows/updateDocs.yaml[GitHub Actions] by executing a link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/main/docs/src/main/asciidoc/ghpages.sh[script] Pivotal wrote.
This script coordinates checking out the new release (by tag or branch name [called 'commitish']), building the refdocs, and pushing them to the `gh-pages` branch, where  GitHub is configured to automatically publish them to `googlecloudplatform.github.io/spring-cloud-gcp`.

. For GA releases, ask on the https://gitter.im/spring-cloud-gcp/Lobby[Spring Cloud GCP Gitter] for the Spring team to update the https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp#learn[API Documentation link] to point to the newly published Ref doc and Javadocs.

. Smoke test changes by running through a handful of our link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/spring[Spring Cloud GCP codelabs] with the newly release version.
Update the instructions as needed.
